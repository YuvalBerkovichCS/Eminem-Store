        Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally
        as Eminem (often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper and record
        producer. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in middle America and
        is critically acclaimed as one of the greatest rappers of all time.
        Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as
        having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in
        popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late
        1990s and early 2000s made him widely controversial, he came to be a
        representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been
        cited as an influence for many artists of various genres.

        After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the extended
        play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's Aftermath
        Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity in 1999
        with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall Mathers LP
        (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes and were
        both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year. After the
        release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on hiatus in 2005,
        largely due to a prescription drug addiction. He returned to the music
        industry four years later with the release of Relapse (2009) and
        Recovery was released the following year. Recovery was the best-selling
        album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's second album, after The
        Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling album of the year worldwide.
        In the following years, he released the US number one albums The
        Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017), Kamikaze (2018) and Music
        to Be Murdered By (2020).

        Eminem is among the best-selling music artists of all time, with
        estimated worldwide sales of over 220 million records. He was the
        best-selling music artist in the United States of the 2000s and the
        best-selling male music artist in the United States of the 2010s, third
        overall. Billboard named him the "Artist of the Decade (2000–2009)". He
        has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200—which all
        consecutively debuted at number one on the chart, making him the first
        artist to achieve this and five number-one singles on the Billboard Hot
        100. The Marshall Mathers LP, The Eminem Show, Curtain Call: The Hits
        (2005), "Lose Yourself", "Love the Way You Lie" and "Not Afraid" have
        all been certified Diamond or higher by the Recording Industry
        Association of America (RIAA). Rolling Stone has included him in its
        lists of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time and the 100 Greatest
        Songwriters of All Time. He has won numerous awards, including 15 Grammy
        Awards, eight American Music Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, an
        Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award and an MTV Europe Music Global
        Icon Award. In November 2022, Eminem was inducted into the Rock and Roll
        Hall of Fame.
